    <span lang="fr">Well, here's Clark Steel. Basically converted from The King Of Fighters 2002, but with some KOF'01, KOF'03 &amp; KOF Neowave stuff. These games were developed by 
      SNK, now known as 
      SNK Playmore and this is my first attempt at converting a character. What else do I need to say ? Paul &amp; Vince, the Ikari Warriors, entered the KOF tournament in 1994 and are known under the names of Clark Steel (Stil, Still, whatever the fuck his name is according to SNK) and Ralf Jones, the third member being commander Heidern. Leona will replace him in the '96 Ikari Team for good.<br>

      <br>
      </font></b>1. This character has been built using sprites and sounds from 
      KOF'01, KOF'02 &amp; KOF'03. Those are <b>copyrighted material</b> <b>and</b> <b>belong to 
      SNK  Playmore</b>. I do not claim property of them for the M.U.G.E.N. 
      use. The Clark Steel M.U.G.E.N. coding files (CNS,AIR,CMD,DEF) are my 
      property though. I would have said the same for the few sprite edits but since 
      80 % of the work was done by SNK, I can't get the full credit for them. Of 
      course that doesn't mean that you can use the sprite edits featured in this 
      character without asking me permission.<br>
      <br>
      2. <b>This character has not been built to replace the original character 
      featured in The King Of Fighters</b>. I mean that the original character 
      plays better &amp; is obviously more accurate than this conversion. M.U.G.E.N. 
      does not and cannot replace the original game.<br>
      <br>
      3. This character has been brought to you thanks to the dozens of hours we 
      spent working on him. You can understand that this is hard work, and hard 
      workers hate being stolen. <b>If you wish to use small portions of Clark 
      code for your character, you can do so without  permission, provided that 
      you credit us for what you used. But if you wish to copy a whole move / a 
      special coding technique</b> <b>or anything 
      that involves a big piece of code, please contact us first.</b>&nbsp; If the 
      portions you require are ones from other creators' work (with 
      permission of course), ask them directly. <br>
      <br>
      4. <b>Do not host this character on your site or on any other site unless I gave 
      authorization to do so</b>. So far, ShinMugen is the only one allowed to 
      host Clark Steel files (<i>via </i>Mugen DEV board).<br>
      <br>
      5. <b>Do not update this character</b>. This aims people who like to take 
      random creations in order to &quot;update&quot; them with stupid super beams, strikers 
      from other games and other shit like that. CDNateur is now the only one who can update 
      it.<br>

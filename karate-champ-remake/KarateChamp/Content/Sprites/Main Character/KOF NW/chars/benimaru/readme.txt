In other words, don't copy this and say you made it, or any part of
it.  Because unless I explicitly state so in the credits section,
you did not.  If you don't think plagiarism is illegal, I suggest
you do a little bit of research. :P

--------------------------------------------------------------------

What's In:
All normal moves
All special moves (98 and 99)
All poses/taunts/etc.
KOF97/98 style Advanced Mode

What's Left:
Nothing, one hopes...

Known Bugs:
1. The Gen'ei Hurricane has no juggle checking, due to a bug that
   prevents helpers from checking p1's juggle points properly.
   When this is fixed, I'll correct the problem.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
                       MISCELLANEOUS NOTES

1. If you don't like the button layout (freak;P), then edit the DEF
   file and set it to use "beni-cap.cmd" for the button layout
   instead.
2. I know the Shinkuu Katategoma is mapped to the punch buttons and
   not the kicks in KOF.  I made the change to balance out his
   movelist.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
                       BACK FROM THE DEAD?

Not quite, though I'm sure some folks will probably think that.  I
have yet to decide if this is a "permanent" return or just a
temporary thing.  All I know is, I had the impulse, I made the
character, and here we go.  Most people out there don't appreciate
the effort creators put into these things.  On the other hand, some
outright mediocre creators, such as one webpage-killing, self-
important, short-tempered, award-clutching, dick-waving,
hypersensitive jerk who wouldn't know an accurate MUGEN conversion
if it bit him on the ass, get lauded for the crap they spew out
continually, like one notorious female SNK character who was worked
on "for months" and "deserved an award," and STILL turned out to be
crap.  And yet people love them.  I don't get it.  I guess I never
will.  Anyhow, do what you want with this.  Spank it, burn it to CD
and crush it with your brother's Razor scooter, just don't change
it.

And as for the password... MUGEN Bank can kiss my fine white ass.

****** Miscellaneous ******
POW Explode                    X+Y+A
  Activates MAX meter.  While meter is active and Benimaru is
  flashing, he does an added 25% damage.  Any DMs performed
  in MAX become SDMs and are much more powerful.

Knockdown Attack 
  (ground or air)              A+B
  Can be used while blocking (only in MAX) to counter
  opponent's move.

Forward Roll                   X+Y
Backward Roll                  back + X+Y
  Either can be used while blocking (only in MAX) to escape
  opponent's move.


--------------------------------------------------------------------
THANKS TO:
1. My girlfriend, for encouraging/harassing me to get this done.
   (If not for her, this wouldn't have been released at all.)
2. SNK, for making a unique and fun-to-play character (why remove
   his grabs in 99 though?).
3. Kyo Kusanagi, for unbelievably helpful info on getting the
   hitstuns correct, and for combotesting.
4. NeoGouki, for his helpful advice on making a better MAX meter,
   not to mention getting the electrified PalFX right.
5. Shadow Watcher, as always, for tons of creative input and beta
   testing.

NO THANKS TO:
1. Idiots who think awards are the reason for character creation.
2. Idiots who think that Benimaru is homosexual.  Get a life.  And
   by the way, Jin Chon Shu, Shizumaru and Amakusa are all MALE.
3. People who can't "read the fucking manual" and feel the need to
   ask questions that have already been plainly answered.
4. Anyone that feels the need to complain that something here isn't
   accurate enough, or is too accurate.  Find a better Benimaru.  I
   dare you.
5. Anyone who doesn't like my button schemes.  See item #4.
6. People who think I "owe" the MUGEN community something.
7. People who don't like KOF.
8. People who take offense at any of this.  Obviously, if it
   offends you, then you're one of the ones at whom it's directed,
   no?  Exactly.
